This is a small memo on deploying a Kafka structure on windows, based on
an online article: https://dzone.com/articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os

The first steps are to install the required packages: Java JRE, Zookeeper and Kafka.

ZooKeeper must be running in its own command line window, listening of port 2181.
For that, open a new command line window and type "zkserver"

Then update the Kafka config file, server.properties in
c:\kafka\kafka_2.12-2.5.0\config\. Start the server in its own commandline window
by running this command from the Kafka installation directory:
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

After that, need to create the required topics, using commands of the form:
kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic <the-topic>
(Commands are in the bin\window directory). Do this for 3 topics:
    m3Capture
    m3Analysis
    m3Thresholder

Then launch each of the required agents in its own command line windows.
This include:
 * SumM3Analysis.py localhost:9092 <data_dir> 
 * SumM3Thresholder.py localhost:9092 <nb_hours>
 * SumM3Graph.py localhost:9092 <data_dir>
 * SumM3Avg.py localhost:9092 <data_dir> <nb_hours_for_pattern> <label> <country_code> <city_code>

 This creates the processing environment for the Kafka chain.
 At this point, in a separate window, launch the "producer" script
 for each summary that shall be entered, for example:
