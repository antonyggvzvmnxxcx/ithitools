    <h1>ITHI Metric EAI, Email Address Internationalization support in  mail servers</h1>
    <p>
        This metric, one of many partial measures for Universal Acceptance of domain names and email
        addresses, tracks the Email Address Internationalization (EAI) support on mail exchanger (MX) servers of
        second level domain names across participating Top Level Domains (TLDs). Currently all gTLDs are being
        surveyed, and other TLDs may be added later. EAI support is measured by running a quarterly survey
        using the TLD zone files and data available in the public DNS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of surveyed servers is generated by parsing the TLD zone file and obtaining the complete list of
        second level domains (SLDs) in each TLD. We then check in the public DNS for existing MX records found
        in the SLDs and get the corresponding IP address(es) that the MX hostnames resolve to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each surveyed IP address is tested for EAI support by verifying if the MX server announces support of the
        SMTPUTF8 extension (See RFC 6531) in an EHLO command response, and checking that the server
        accepts the MAIL FROM command when provided internationalized email addresses with non-ASCII
        characters in the local part (left of the @ sign) and an internationalized domain name as A-label (ASCII
        mapping, e.g., xn--test) as well as U-label (using raw Unicode).
    </p>
    <p>
        The quarterly survey results are provided in CSV format and each column is described below:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>#</th><th>Column</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>
            1</td><td>Survey date</td><td>The date the EAI survey measurements was started
            (the survey takes a couple of days to complete).
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>
            2</td><td>TLD</td><td>
            The TLD (A-label form for IDN TLDs) to which the aggregated results
            correspond.
            Each quarterly report includes a summary line where the numbers
            correspond to the aggregated total of unique values across all TLDs
            where the TLD column will show an empty value.
