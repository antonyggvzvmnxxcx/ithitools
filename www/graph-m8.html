    <h1>M8: DNS Authoritative Servers Analysis</h1>
    <h2 id="dateHeading">-</h2>
    <p>
        The M8 metrics analyze the DNS traffic at Authoritative Servers. The
        data collected by participating servers gives us a good statistical
        sampling of that traffic originating from recursive resolvers, or
        from clients interacting directly with authoritative servers.
        We track this behavior with several metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first metric, M8.1 is about usage.
        In the following table, the <em>current value</em> is the
        value of the metric for the current month.
        The following table provides the value observed for the
        metric in the current month, as well as the average value over the 3 previous months,
        and the "historical" minimum and maximum observed since the beginning of the measurements.
    </p>
    <table class="metrics">
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th class="number" id="currentId1">Current Value</th>
            <th class="number">Past 3 months</th>
            <th class="number">Historic Low</th>
            <th class="number">Historic High</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                M8.1: % NX Domain Queries at Authoritative
                <a href="about-m8.html">(?)</a>
            </td>
            <td class="number" id="valM81">
                -
            </td>
            <td class="number" id="averageM81">
                -
            </td>
            <td class="number" id="minM81">
                -
            </td>
            <td class="number" id="maxM81">
                -
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The next three metrics are about properties of the resolvers. Resolvers are identified by IP address,
        and a given IP address is only counted once. For a given server, the ratios are computed over the total number
        of resolvers that contacted this server. The ratios measured at different authoritative
        servers are then averaged to compute the metric. The metrics tracking resolver behavior are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            M8.2: usage of Extended DNS (EDNS) by resolvers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    M8.2.1: the fraction of resolvers that use Extended DNS (EDNS).
                </li>
                <li>
                    M8.2.2.X: the fraction of resolvers that use Extended DNS option X.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            M8.3: the fraction of DNS Resolvers that sent requests with the EDNS "DNSSEC OK"
            option set.
        </li>

        <li>
            M8.4: the fraction of DNS Resolvers that are probably using QName Minimization.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following table provides the value observed for the
        metrics in the current month, as well as the average value over the 3 previous months,
        and the "historical" minimum and maximum observed since the beginning of the measurements.
