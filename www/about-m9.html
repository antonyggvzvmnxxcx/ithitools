        The M9 metrics analyze the concentration of the authoritative DNS
        server market. We want to estimate the relative share of companies
        providing DNS servers to independent domain owners. We ave observed
        that the answer varies depending on which domains are
        considered. We extract from the <a xref="http://downloads.majestic.com/majestic_million.csv">
            "majestic million"
        </a> list a set of five categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Top 100 domains,</li>
        <li> Next 900 domains,</li>
        <li> Next 9000 domains,</li>
        <li> Next 90000 domains,</li>
        <li> Next 900000 domains.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        To estimate the market for small domains not in the majectic million list,
        we analyze the domains listed in the COM Zone. This give us a total of
        six metric categories, identified as:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Submetric</th>
            <th>Category</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>M9.1</td><td> Top 100 domains,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.2</td><td> Next 900 domains,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.3</td><td> Next 9000 domains,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.4</td><td> Next 90000 domains,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.5</td><td> Next 900000 domains.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.6</td><td> Domains in COM zone</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        In each of these categories, we count the number of "services" that provide
        servers for the selected domain. For that, we start by getting the NS records for the
        domain, and we try to recognize the "service" to which that record belongs.
        In many cases, this is just the apex name, but we also use tables of "equivalent
        names" to recognize big services like cloudflare or AWS. There are very often multiple
        NS records for a domain, which very often point to a single service but sometimes
        point to several different services. We adopt a couple of simple convention:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We define a service reference as the existence for the domain of one
        or several NS records pointing to a given service.</li>
        <li>There can be multiple name server records per domain name,
        pointing to different services, but we consider at most one reference from a given domain
        to a specific service.</li>
        <li>We define market share of a service as the sum of references pointing to a
        this service, divided by the total number of references.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We get 4 submetrics:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Submetric</th>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Definition</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>M9.x.1</td><td></td><td> Average number of services references for a domain,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.x.2</td><td></td><td> Smallest number of services accounting for 50% references,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.x.3</td><td></td><td> Smallest number of services accounting for 90% references,</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M9.x.4</td><td>service name</td><td> Top services and their relative share of references.</td></tr>
    </table>
